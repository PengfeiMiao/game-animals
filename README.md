I create the main_menu.xml,display.xml and other two tip xml with layout and layout-land method;

Then I all use the xxhpi style png file for display;

In the MainMenuActivity I deal with all the events: 

start the app,dispay the image,nagative to other xml and overload the orientationChanged function.
